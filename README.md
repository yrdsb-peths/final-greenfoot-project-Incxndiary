# Final Greenfoot Project
This is a basic tank game that I created for a project.
The rules of the game are simple: use the W, A, S, D keys to move and left click mouse to shoot
The goal of the game is to survive while killing the enemy tanks
There are two types of enemy tanks and they spawn randomly, so there is no pattern in "beating the game"
